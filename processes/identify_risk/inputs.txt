Key elements of the risk management plan that contribute to the Identify Risks process are the assignments of roles and responsibilities, provision for risk management activities in the budget
and schedule, and categories of risk, which are sometimes expressed as a risk breakdown structure.

The cost management plan provides processes and controls that can be used to help identify risks across the project.


The schedule management plan provides insight to project time/schedule
objectives and expectations which may be impacted by risks (known and unknown).


 The quality management plan provides a baseline of quality measures and metrics
for use in identifying risks.

 The human resource management plan provides guidance on how project human
resources should be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released. It can also contain roles and responsibilities,
project organization charts, and the staffing management plan, which form a key input to identify risk processes.






Project assumptions are found in the project scope statement. Uncertainty in
project assumptions should be evaluated as potential causes of project risk.
The WBS is a critical input to identifying risks as it facilitates an understanding of the potential risks at both
the micro and macro levels. Risks can be identified and subsequently tracked at summary, control account, and/or
work package levels.

Activity cost estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks as they provide a quantitative assessment of the likely cost to complete scheduled activities and ideally are expressed as a range,
with the width of the range indicating the degree(s) of risk. The review may result in projections indicating the
estimate is either sufficient or insufficient to complete the activity (pose a risk to the project).

Activity duration estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks related to the time
allowances for the activities or project as a whole, again with the width of the range of such estimates indicating
the relative degree(s) of risk.

Information about the stakeholders is useful for soliciting inputs to identify risks,
as this will ensure that key stakeholders, especially the stakeholder, sponsor, and customer are interviewed or
otherwise participate during the Identify Risks process.



Project documents provide the project team with information about decisions that help better identify project
risks. Project documents improve cross-team and stakeholder communications and include, but are not limited to:
•         Project charter,
•         Project schedule,
•         Schedule network diagrams,
•         Issue log,
•         Quality checklist, and
•         Other information proven to be valuable in identifying risks.

If the project requires external procurement of resources, procurement
documents become a key input to the Identify Risks process. The complexity and the level of detail of the
procurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks associated with, planned procurement.




Enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Identify Risks process
include, but are not limited to:
•         Published information, including commercial databases,
•         Academic studies,
•         Published checklists,
•         Benchmarking,
•         Industry studies, and
•         Risk attitudes.


Organizational process assets that can influence the Identify Risks process include,
but are not limited to:
•         Project files, including actual data,
•         Organizational and project process controls,
•         Risk statement formats or templates, and
•         Lessons learned.
