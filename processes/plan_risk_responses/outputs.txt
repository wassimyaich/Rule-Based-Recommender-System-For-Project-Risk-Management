Elements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include,
but are not limited to:
The schedule management plan is updated to reflect changes in process
and practice driven by the risk responses. This may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to
resource loading and leveling, as well as updates to the schedule strategy.
The cost management plan is updated to reflect changes in process and
practice driven by the risk responses. This may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to
cost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency
reserves are consumed.
The quality management plan is updated to reflect changes in process
and practice driven by the risk responses. This may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to
requirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the requirements documentation.
The procurement management plan may be updated to reflect
changes in strategy, such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s) driven by the risk responses.
The staffing management plan, part of the human resource
management plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource
applications driven by the risk responses. This may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to
staff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.
Because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope
baseline may be updated to reflect those changes.
Because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule
baseline may be updated to reflect those changes.
 Because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline
may be updated to reflect those changes.


In the Plan Risk Responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. For example, when
appropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. The risk register
should be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. Often, the
high and moderate risks are addressed in detail. Risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for
periodic monitoring. Updates to the risk register can include, but are not limited to:
• Risk owners and assigned responsibilities;
• Agreed-upon response strategies;
• Specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;
• Trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence;
• Budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;
• Contingency plans and triggers that call for their execution;
• Fallback plans for use as a reaction to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be
inadequate;
• Residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that
have been deliberately accepted;
• Secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response; and
• Contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the
organization’s risk thresholds.
Other project documents updated could include:
• Assumptions log updates. As new information becomes available through the application of risk
responses, assumptions could change. The assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.
As new information becomes available through the application
of risk responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change. Any supporting
documentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.
Planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes
to the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes.
When such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the
Perform Integrated Change Control process.


Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The
resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders.
In addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning
objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the
organization’s management and other stakeholders.


The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and
other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner.
A single risk owner should be assigned to every identified risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should
have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is
expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority
of these roles.
Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior
management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves.


Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be
scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be
monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them.


Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated
into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the
budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners
and risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing
risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources.


Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause.
Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, affinity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk
Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process
(ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic
responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect
the probability or impact of other risks.
Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be
mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby
increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed
responses and make sure they are coherent.
The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the
strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can
actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.


In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon,
assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria:
• Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;
• Technical feasibility;
• Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding
actions; and
• Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in the risk profile of the project.


Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide
for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid.
Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the first
response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the
strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.
Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical
level and integrated into the project management plan ( schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This
activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.




The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project level
risks. 
The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies.


This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure
either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and
the project will be able to take advantage of it.


This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or opportunity.


Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the
approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the
probability and/or the impact of an opportunity.
This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails
taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed
ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself.


In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address
overall project risk as follows:
• Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.
• Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.
• Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the
project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc.
• Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.
