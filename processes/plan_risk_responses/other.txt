Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce
threats to project objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting
resources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed.


The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority
of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholdersâ€™ risk attitudes and
the conventions specified in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that
were determined when the risks were identified and analyzed.

Risk response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the
Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred
to as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register.


The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any
interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities
and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities
are clearly identified and recorded.
While developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for
inclusion in a modified project management plan. These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling
details, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the
additional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete.


Once the risk responses have been defined and integrated into the project management plan, the individual
and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response
planning is required. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected
post-response situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed
responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented.
