In planning risk management, all approved subsidiary management plans and baselines should be taken into
consideration in order to make the risk management plan consistent with them. The risk management plan is also
a component of the project management plan. The project management plan provides a baseline or current state of risk-affected areas including scope, schedule, and cost.


The project charter can provide various inputs such as high-level risks, high-level
project descriptions, and high-level requirements.


The stakeholder register, which contains all details related to the project’s
stakeholders, provides an overview of their roles.


The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Risk Management
process include, but are not limited to, risk attitudes, thresholds, and tolerances that describe the degree of risk that an organization will withstand.


The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Risk Management
process include, but are not limited to:


•         Risk categories,
