Project documents that may be updated include, but are not limited to: •	 risk register updates. As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk assessment, the risk register is updated. Updates to the risk register may include assessments of probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk categorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis. •	 Assumptions log updates. As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk assessment, assumptions could change. The assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information. Assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a separate assumptions log.
