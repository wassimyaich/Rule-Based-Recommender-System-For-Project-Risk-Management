Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision making in order to reduce project uncertainty

The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously. Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders.
It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the beneﬁ ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort. 
Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 
Speciﬁc project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁed at a detailed level such as the line-item cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or the schedule are speciﬁed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁed risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:
 • Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.   
• Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a level of detail that lends itself to speciﬁc assessment of individual risks. 
•  Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.
•   Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.

results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:
• What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives?   
• How much contingency reserve (reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? 
• What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?  
• Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?

Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on 

The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their effects quantitatively.

An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule (for time), line-item cost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used.

often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support.

Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. 

The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁed at the level of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.

 Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together. 

The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. 
Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of conﬁ dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results.
