The primary output from Identify Risks is the initial entry into the risk register. The risk register is a document
in which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded. It contains the outcomes of the other
risk management processes as they are conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information
contained in the risk register over time. The preparation of the risk register begins in the Identify Risks process
with the following information, and then becomes available to other project management and risk management
processes:
The identified risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. A
structure for describing risks using risk statements may be applied, for example, EVENT may occur
causing IMPACT, or If CAUSE exists, EVENT may occur leading to EFFECT. In addition to the list of
identified risks, the root causes of those risks may become more evident. These are the fundamental
conditions or events that may give rise to one or more identified risks. They should be recorded and
used to support future risk identification for this and other projects.
 Potential responses to a risk may sometimes be identified during the Identify
Risks process. These responses, if identified in this process, should be used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process.




 The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information
currently available for each identified risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register.
This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also
include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses.
