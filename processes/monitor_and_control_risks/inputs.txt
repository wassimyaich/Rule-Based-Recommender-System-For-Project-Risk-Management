The project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides guidance for risk monitoring and controlling.
The risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, control actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, symptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time and cost contingency reserves. The watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks.
 Work performance data related to various performance results possibly impacted by risks includes, but is not limited to: •	Deliverable status, •	Schedule progress, and •	Costs incurred.
Work performance reports take information from performance measurements and analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and forecasting data. These data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.
